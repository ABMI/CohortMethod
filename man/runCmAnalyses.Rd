\arguments{
\item{connectionDetails}{An R object of type \code{connectionDetails} created
using the function \code{createConnectionDetails} in
the \code{DatabaseConnector} package.}

\item{cdmDatabaseSchema}{The name of the database schema that contains the OMOP
CDM instance. Requires read permissions to this
database. On SQL Server, this should specifiy both the
database and the schema, so for example
'cdm_instance.dbo'.}

\item{oracleTempSchema}{For Oracle only: the name of the database schema where
you want all temporary tables to be managed. Requires
create/insert permissions to this database.}

\item{exposureDatabaseSchema}{The name of the database schema that is the location
where the exposure data used to define the exposure
cohorts is available. If exposureTable = DRUG_ERA,
exposureDatabaseSchema is not used by assumed to be
cdmSchema.  Requires read permissions to this database.}

\item{exposureTable}{The tablename that contains the exposure cohorts.  If
exposureTable <> DRUG_ERA, then expectation is
exposureTable has format of COHORT table:
COHORT_DEFINITION_ID, SUBJECT_ID, COHORT_START_DATE,
COHORT_END_DATE.}

\item{outcomeDatabaseSchema}{The name of the database schema that is the location
where the data used to define the outcome cohorts is
available. If exposureTable = CONDITION_ERA,
exposureDatabaseSchema is not used by assumed to be
cdmSchema.  Requires read permissions to this database.}

\item{outcomeTable}{The tablename that contains the outcome cohorts.  If
outcomeTable <> CONDITION_OCCURRENCE, then expectation
is outcomeTable has format of COHORT table:
COHORT_DEFINITION_ID, SUBJECT_ID, COHORT_START_DATE,
COHORT_END_DATE.}

\item{outputFolder}{Name of the folder where all the outputs will written
to.}

\item{cmAnalysisList}{A list of objects of type \code{cmAnalysis} as created
using the \code{\link{createCmAnalysis}} function.}

\item{drugComparatorOutcomesList}{A list of objects of type \code{drugComparatorOutcomes}
as created using the
\code{\link{createdrugComparatorOutcomes}} function.}

\item{refitPsForEveryOutcome}{Should the propensity model be fitted for every outcome
(i.e. after people who already had the outcome are
removed)? If false, a single propensity model will be
fitted, and people who had the outcome previously will
be removed afterwards.}

\item{underSampleComparatorToTreatedRatio}{If the comparator group size exceeds the treated group
size by this factor, the comparator group will be
down-sampled before fitting the PS model. This can be
useful when the comparator group is extremely large.}

\item{getDbCohortMethodDataThreads}{The number of parallel threads to use for building the
cohortMethod data objects.}

\item{createPsThreads}{The number of parallel threads to use for fitting the
propensity models.}

\item{psCvThreads}{The number of parallel threads to use for the cross-
validation when estimating the hyperparameter for the
propensity model. Note that the total number of CV threads
at one time could be `createPsThreads * psCvThreads`.}

\item{fitOutcomeModelThreads}{The number of parallel threads to use for fitting the
outcome models.}

\item{outcomeCvThreads}{The number of parallel threads to use for the cross-
                                             validation when estimating the hyperparameter for the
                                             outcome model. Note that the total number of CV threads
                                             at one time could be `fitOutcomeModelThreads * outcomeCvThreads`.}

\item{computeCovarBalThreads}{The number of parallel threads to use for computing the
covariate balance.}

\description{
Run a list of analyses
}
\details{
Run a list of analyses for the drug-comparator-outcomes of interest. This function will run all
specified analyses against all hypotheses of interest, meaning that the total number of outcome
models is `length(cmAnalysisList) * length(drugComparatorOutcomesList)` (if all analyses specify an
outcome model should be fitted). When you provide several analyses it will determine whether any of
the analyses have anything in common, and will take advantage of this fact. For example, if we
specify several analyses that only differ in the way the outcome model is fitted, then this
function will extract the data and fit the propensity model only once, and re-use this in all the
analysis.
