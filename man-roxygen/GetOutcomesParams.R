#' @param outcomeDatabaseSchema     The name of the database schema that is the location where the data used to define the outcome cohorts is available.  If exposureTable = CONDITION_ERA, exposureDatabaseSchema is not used by assumed to be cdmSchema.  Requires read permissions to this database.    
#' @param outcomeTable   The tablename that contains the outcome cohorts.  If outcomeTable <> CONDITION_OCCURRENCE, then expectation is outcomeTable has format of COHORT table: COHORT_DEFINITION_ID, SUBJECT_ID, COHORT_START_DATE, COHORT_END_DATE.   
#' @param outcomeConceptIds 	A list of CONCEPT_IDs used to define outcomes.  If outcomeTable = CONDITION_OCCURRENCE, the list is a set of ancestor CONCEPT_IDs, and all occurrences of all descendant concepts will be selected.  If outcomeTable <> CONDITION_OCCURRENCE, the list contains records found in COHORT_DEFINITION_ID field.
#' @param outcomeConditionTypeConceptIds   A list of TYPE_CONCEPT_ID values that will restrict condition occurrences.  Only applicable if outcomeTable = CONDITION_OCCURRENCE.
